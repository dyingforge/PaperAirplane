✈️ PaperPlane 
Send your thoughts across the world, one paper plane at a time.
🌍 Project Overview

PaperPlane is a fun and interactive decentralized application built for the Walrus Hackathon, combining the magic of Seal and Walrus to create an exciting experience.
The idea is simple:

Users can create their own paper planes, write a short message or comment on them, and send them out into the digital world.

Then, they can randomly pick up someone else’s paper plane, leave a comment on it, and send it off into the unknown.

After a certain amount of time, each user will receive their own sent paper planes back, now filled with the comments and thoughts from other users.

It’s a fun way to share thoughts, leave surprises, and see how others interact with your ideas!

🧩 How It Works

Create a Paper Plane

Users can create a paper plane with a short message or comment.

Once created, the paper plane is sent out into the system, ready to be picked up by others.

Pick a Random Paper Plane

Users can browse and pick a random paper plane.

After picking, they can leave a comment on it, adding their own thoughts.

Then, they send it off into the system again, waiting for someone else to pick it up.

Receive Paper Planes

After a set period of time, users will receive their originally sent paper planes back.

The paper plane now contains comments and messages left by others, giving a delightful surprise and a glimpse of how their ideas were perceived.

Walrus Integration

The system uses Walrus for decentralized storage of the paper planes and comments, ensuring that all messages and interactions are secure and immutable.

Seal helps in managing the randomness of paper plane assignment and comment distribution.

🚀 Key Features

Creative Sharing: Send out your thoughts on a paper plane and let others respond to it in their own creative way.

Random Discovery: Pick up random paper planes from other users and add your own comments.

Surprise Returns: Get your paper planes back after a certain time with comments and messages from others.

Decentralized Storage: All messages and interactions are stored securely using Walrus.

No Central Authority: The randomness and anonymity of interactions make the experience playful and fun without a centralized controlling system.

🧠 Tech Stack

Blockchain: Sui (for smart contracts and token logic)

Storage: Walrus (decentralized content storage)

Randomness Engine: Seal (for managing the randomness of paper plane exchanges)

Frontend: React, TypeScript

Smart Contracts: Move language (on the Sui blockchain)

💰 Economic Model

No Fees: The platform is completely free to use — no fees for sending or receiving paper planes.

Token Incentives: Users earn tokens (or rewards) based on how many paper planes they send, comment on, or interact with, promoting engagement and community building.

Platform Rewards: Users who engage with many planes, or whose planes receive the most interactions, can earn special recognition and rewards.

🚀 Future Roadmap

Paper Plane NFTs: Allow users to mint their unique paper planes as NFTs for added ownership and collectability.

Social Features: Create a leaderboard to track the most commented-on or most creative paper planes.

Gamification: Add achievements and badges for users who send, comment, or receive a certain number of paper planes.

Cross-Platform Integration: Allow users to integrate the platform with social media or other blockchain applications for wider interaction.
