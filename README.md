📄 [Project Name] (e.g., SealPlane / Walrus Flyer)Where decentralized storage meets digital serendipity. > ✈️ Throw a paper plane into the Walrus sea, let strangers leave their marks, and wait for it to drift back home.(建议放一张项目Banner，画风可以偏手绘或极简风)💡 InspirationIn a world of instant messaging, we lost the anticipation of waiting. [Project Name] brings back the romance of "Drifting Bottles" or "Paper Airplanes" using Web3 technology.By leveraging Walrus for decentralized storage and Seal mechanics for privacy and encapsulation, we create a trustless, permanent, and serendipitous social experiment. Your thoughts aren't just stored; they drift through the decentralized web, collecting stories before returning to you.✨ Key Features✈️ Fold & Seal (Create):Users can write text, upload images, or attach small files.Content is stored permanently on Walrus.The plane is "Sealed" with a time-lock mechanism (e.g., 24 hours, 7 days).🎲 Drift & Catch (Interact):Users can randomly "catch" a flying paper plane from the network.Privacy First: Catchers can view the content but cannot alter the original message.✍️ Leave a Mark (Comment):Catchers can stamp the plane or leave a comment. These comments are appended to the plane's metadata on Walrus.The plane is then thrown back into the pool.🏠 Return Home (Reveal):Once the time-lock expires, the plane automatically appears in the creator's inbox.The creator unseals it to see the journey: who caught it and what they said.🛠 How it Works (Under the Hood)This project deeply integrates Walrus and Seal to ensure data availability and interactive mechanics.Architecture代码段graph TD

Storage (Walrus):We use Walrus to store the heavy lifting: the body of the letter, images, and the chain of comments.Each Paper Plane is essentially a Walrus Blob ID.Why Walrus? It ensures that the memories (planes) remain accessible and decentralized, cheaper than on-chain storage, but more permanent than IPFS pinning services.The "Seal" Mechanic:(在这里简要描述你是如何结合Seal的，比如：)We use [Seal Tech/Logic] to encrypt the content or manage the ownership transfer. Only the current holder can view the content, ensuring the "Drift" feels authentic.Smart Contract (Sui Move):Manages the state of the plane (Flying, Caught, Returned).Handles the randomness of "catching" a plane.📸 Demo / ScreenshotsCreate PlaneCatch & CommentReturned Plane🚀 Getting StartedPrerequisitesNode.js > 16.0Walrus Client / SUI Wallet[Other dependencies]InstallationClone the repo:Bashgit clone https://github.com/your-username/project-name.git
